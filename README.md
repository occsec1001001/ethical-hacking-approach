# A work in progress during my oscp learning - building my approach and overall configs and references.
* * *

Building my own framework and steps for my ethical hacking approach whislt studying for OSCP

A total work in progress which will continually evolve as I find my own flow and method

Building template out in [Joplin](https://joplinapp.org/), will duplicate in [cherrytree](https://pkgs.org/download/cherrytree), to add once refined enough to be useful for others on the same journey to help spread the love in securing others.

I have taken some knowledge from others sharing support and resources, sorry for not noting where originally found, I will attempt to ensure credit is given to those I have relied on during my journey.
